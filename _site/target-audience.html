  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <div class="page-content">
    <h1 id="clarion-target-audience">Clarion: Target Audience</h1>

<p>Clarion is designed for organizations responsible for managing critical, complex infrastructure. The primary users fall into the following roles:</p>

<h3 id="primary-audience-small-to-medium-sized-water-utilities">Primary Audience: Small to Medium-Sized Water Utilities</h3>
<p>This is the core target market. These organizations often have limited IT staff and budgets, and their institutional knowledge is frequently spread across paper documents, siloed spreadsheets, and the memory of senior operators.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Utility Managers &amp; Directors:</strong> Need a high-level overview of system health, ongoing projects, and operational risks. They benefit from the dashboard views, AI-powered querying for quick answers, and project management oversight.</li>
  <li><strong>Water System Operators:</strong> Responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system. They use Clarion to quickly find asset information, access service manuals, view network maps, log field notes, and manage maintenance tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Engineers &amp; Planners:</strong> Use the hydraulic modeling and simulation features to plan for future demand, analyze system vulnerabilities, and design system upgrades. The ability to generate models from the graph is a key time-saver.</li>
  <li><strong>GIS Technicians:</strong> Benefit from the direct integration of GIS data, reducing the need to switch between systems to correlate asset data with geographic location.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="secondary-markets">Secondary Markets</h3>
<p>The underlying technology of Clarion is adaptable to other infrastructure domains:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wastewater Management:</strong> Similar needs for asset management, network modeling, and document integration.</li>
  <li><strong>Electrical Grids:</strong> Managing transformers, substations, and transmission lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Transportation Networks:</strong> Managing roads, signals, and related assets.</li>
  <li><strong>Facilities Management:</strong> For large campuses (universities, hospitals) with complex utility and building systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ideal customer is any organization feeling the pain of “data silos” and looking to preserve and operationalize their institutional knowledge in a single, intelligent platform.</p>
