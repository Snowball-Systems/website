# About Snowball Systems

<div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem; padding: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #6fa8dc;">Our Mission</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Snowball Systems, LLC is a consulting and software development firm focused on helping small and mid-sized water utilities preserve & leverage institutional knowledge to modernize operations and enhance collaborative decision-making.</p>
</div>

## Who We Are

We combine engineering insight, intuitive software, and integrated data architecture to support utilities in their transition to smarter, more resilient systems. Our team includes licensed professional engineers, GIS experts, and software developers with experience across utility infrastructure planning, knowledge management, and AI system design.

## The Challenge We Solve

We are particularly focused on solving a growing challenge for water districts: **the risk of losing operational expertise due to retirements, siloed information, and aging digital infrastructure.**

Too many utilities face the reality of critical knowledge walking out the door with retiring employees, while important operational data remains trapped in paper documents, isolated spreadsheets, and the memories of senior operators.

## Our Philosophy

Our approach is **iterative, open, and grounded in utility operations**. We believe in building on technologies already in use while offering a forward-looking foundation for digital transformation.

We don't believe in replacing what works — we believe in connecting it, enhancing it, and making it smarter.

## Clarion: Our Flagship Platform

    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #6fa8dc;">Built for Real Utilities</h3>
    <p>Clarion, our flagship platform, reflects this philosophy: it builds on technologies already in use (ArcGIS Pro, FlexNet AMI), while offering a forward-looking foundation for digital transformation.</p>
    
    <p>Rather than forcing utilities to abandon their existing systems, Clarion creates intelligent connections between them, turning isolated data into actionable insights.</p>
