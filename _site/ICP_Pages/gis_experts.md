🗺️ Clarion for GIS Consultants
Header: “ArcGIS is your foundation. Clarion makes it intelligent.”

🔍 Acknowledge What’s Out There
Many utilities already use ArcGIS-based systems to track assets, issue work orders, and maintain spatial databases.

Tools like:

Cityworks / Elements XS for CMMS-style maintenance tracking

Cartegraph for infrastructure inventory and inspections

Field Maps & Survey123 for collecting field data

These are powerful — and they’re built on a platform you know.

💡 But Here’s What Clarion Does Differently
Where traditional GIS-based platforms manage data,
Clarion manages context.

Clarion deeply indexes all the information around your GIS assets — so staff can search, ask questions, and act with clarity.

🔑 Key Differentiators for GIS Consultants
✅ 1. Contextual Search + Semantic Links
Link maintenance logs, SOPs, manuals, meeting notes, and engineering reports directly to GIS assets

Full-text searchable, but also semantically structured: Clarion understands asset relationships, history, and topology

💬 Ask: “When was this pump last rebuilt?” — and get an answer, not just a folder.

✅ 2. Natural Language Assistant for Non-GIS Staff
Operators and admin staff don’t need to navigate ArcGIS or know layer names

Clarion’s AI assistant lets anyone ask about assets, locations, tasks, or history — in plain English

🧠 “Which valves need flushing this month?” → Clarion answers, from GIS + logs

✅ 3. Cross-Platform Intelligence
GIS is just one source — Clarion integrates with AMI (e.g. Sensus), SCADA, hydraulic models, and docs

The knowledge graph keeps it all in sync, using asset IDs and topology as the connective tissue

🧩 Your GIS becomes the heart of a smart utility ecosystem.

🚀 Why GIS Consultants Bring in Clarion
Keeps your ArcGIS work actively used across teams

Bridges your deliverables to daily operations

Positions you to offer long-term services: onboarding, QA, data linking

“With Clarion, I didn’t just deliver a map. I delivered a system they use every day.”

 A GIS consultant’s motivation to introduce Clarion to their existing clients is rooted in increased value, long-term engagement, and professional differentiation. Here's a breakdown of the top motivations:

✅ 1. Clarion Extends Their Work Beyond the GIS Department
Most GIS consultants deliver incredible spatial data — but that data often gets siloed.

🔁 With Clarion:

That GIS work now powers knowledge management, training, operations, and engineering decisions

The consultant’s role expands from "map builder" to systems integrator and digital transformation partner

“I gave them more than a map — I gave them something they actually use daily.”

✅ 2. Clarion Creates Sticky, Ongoing Engagement
Clarion isn’t a one-and-done tool. It opens up:

Future integrations (AMI, SCADA, hydraulic modeling)

Asset knowledge curation and SOP linking

Staff training and onboarding support

💡 This enables ongoing consulting opportunities:

Data linking

Quality assurance

Custom dashboards and automation

Acting as their “GIS + Clarion advisor”

More revenue. Longer contracts. A seat at the digital strategy table.

✅ 3. Professional Differentiation
Most consultants are still handing off PDFs and static maps. Clarion lets the GIS consultant say:

“We don’t just map assets — we make them intelligent.”

This positions the consultant as an innovator — someone bringing new value to aging infrastructure and resource-constrained utilities.

✅ 4. Empower the Utility Staff — While Reducing Support Burden
Clarion's AI assistant and unified search mean:

Staff ask Clarion questions instead of emailing the GIS consultant

The GIS data becomes discoverable and understandable by everyone (not just ArcGIS users)

→ The consultant spends less time answering basic questions
→ More time doing high-value work (QA, analytics, training)

✅ 5. Future-Proofing Their Client
When consultants introduce Clarion, they help their clients:

Capture knowledge from retiring staff

Lay the groundwork for smart utility upgrades (AMI, modeling, etc.)

Prevent their GIS investment from fading into irrelevance

“You’ve built this amazing spatial database — let’s make sure it gets used every day.”
