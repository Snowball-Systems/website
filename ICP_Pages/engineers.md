## Problem We Solve

You build great systems — but then what?

Your clients are buried in PDFs, emails, and scattered knowledge. You wait days for a single asset spec or operational SOP. Your plans go stale before they're even implemented.

## What Clarion Does for Engineers

### 🔁 Living Master Plan
Tie your hydraulic model, reports, and system recommendations into a dynamic interface your client can use — daily.

- **Host models directly in Clarion**
- **Enable "what-if" scenario exploration**
- **Connect your plan to real-world system status & updates**

<div class="highlight-box">
🟦 **No more plans that gather dust.** You're giving your clients something they can build on.
</div>

### 🔍 Query the Client's System, Not Their Inbox
Stop waiting on info requests.

- **Search SOPs, asset history, and project docs via semantic knowledge graph**
- **Ask Clarion:**
  - "Where are the highest nighttime demands?"
  - "Has this zone ever had pressure complaints?"

<div class="highlight-box">
🟦 **Save hours every week.** Get what you need when you need it.
</div>

### 🤝 Tighter Collaboration Without Email Overload
Get a role-based login as a trusted partner.

- **Access tagged documents, tasks, and workflows**
- **Leave notes, receive alerts, and follow changes to the parts of the system you care about**

<div class="highlight-box">
🟦 **Be the engineer they call first — because you're already in the loop.**
</div>

### 💡 Bonus: A Differentiator for Your Proposals
Offer Clarion as part of your service.

**"We don't just leave you with a binder. We empower your team to use this plan every day."**

<div class="highlight-box">
🟦 **Clarion makes your firm the long-term partner, not just the consultant.**
