 Clarion for Utility Engineers
Header: “Deliver lasting value. Work closer with your clients. Spend less time chasing context.”

📍 Problem We Solve (Top Section)
You build great systems — but then what?
Your clients are buried in PDFs, emails, and scattered knowledge. You wait days for a single asset spec or operational SOP. Your plans go stale before they’re even implemented.

✅ What Clarion Does for Engineers
🔁 1. A Living Master Plan
Tie your hydraulic model, reports, and system recommendations into a dynamic interface your client can use — daily.

Host models directly in Clarion

Enable “what-if” scenario exploration

🟦 No more plans that gather dust. You’re giving your clients something they can build on.

🔍 2. Query the Client’s System, Not Their Inbox
Stop waiting on info requests.

Search SOPs, asset history, and project docs via semantic knowledge graph
